# KCDFW
KCDFW is a Lua scripting framework for Kingdom Come: Deliverance mods.


## Requirements
Building also requires 7za and (technically optionally) Make.


## Building
Building is done by simply invoking `make` in the repo root.
Building was tested successfully on both Debian 10 and the Ubuntu 18 Subsystem on Windows.


## Installing
After building, you can obtain the mod's archive from the `dist/` folder. Extract this archive in the `Mods/` folder in your Kingdom Come: Deliverance installation folder, e.g.: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\Mods`.
